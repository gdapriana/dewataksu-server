# API Documentation: Likes

This document covers all endpoints related to managing user likes. Likes are polymorphic and can be associated with Destinations, Traditions, or Stories.

## üëç Data Model: Like

The `Like` object creates a link between a `User` and another model (`Destination`, `Tradition`, or `Story`) to signify appreciation.

| Field           | Type                | Description                              |
| :-------------- | :------------------ | :--------------------------------------- |
| `id`            | `String` (CUID)     | A unique identifier for the like entry.  |
| `userId`        | `String`            | The ID of the user who created the like. |
| `destinationId` | `String` (Optional) | The ID of the liked destination.         |
| `traditionId`   | `String` (Optional) | The ID of the liked tradition.           |
| `storyId`       | `String` (Optional) | The ID of the liked story.               |
| `createdAt`     | `DateTime`          | The timestamp when the like was created. |
